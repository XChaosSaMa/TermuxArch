# TermuxArch

This is a personal script to install Arch on Termux with the AUR and Blackarch repositories. I will improve the script over time.

Instructions:
1. Give disk read permissions to termux
> termux-setup-storage
2. Move the downloaded script to the home directory
> mv storage/downloads/TermuxArch.sh .
3. Give the execution permit
> chmod +x TermuxArch.sh
4. Run it 
> ./TermuxArch.sh
